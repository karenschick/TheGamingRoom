The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a game development company that originally launched the game Draw It or Lose It as an Android application. They partnered with Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to redesign the game as a web-based, cross-platform application. The Gaming Room's software requirements included support for multiple teams and players, the use of unique identifiers for games, teams, and players, and a mechanism to ensure only one active game instance exists at any time. Additionally, they emphasized the need for a scalable, secure, and high-performance application that would function seamlessly across various operating systems and devices.

In developing the software design documentation, one of the areas I executed particularly well was in outlining the system architecture, domain model, and platform evaluations. These elements provided strong technical justification for design choices. I effectively applied object-oriented programming principles—encapsulation, inheritance, and the singleton pattern—and clearly documented how serverless and client-server architectural models would be integrated to ensure both scalability and cross-platform compatibility. My recommendations section was also comprehensive, addressing key technical concerns such as storage, memory optimization, and security.

Working through the design document proved to be a helpful and structured approach that guided the development process. It allowed me to define class responsibilities, visualize relationships in a domain model, and choose appropriate architectural patterns early on. This upfront planning reduced uncertainty during coding and supported the development of modular, maintainable code. Most importantly, it ensured that the final product remained closely aligned with the client's requirements, saving time during implementation and testing.

If I were to revise any section of the documentation, I would enhance the evaluation portion by including more quantitative performance metrics. Using benchmarks such as estimated response times, memory usage, and concurrent user loads for different operating systems—like Linux, macOS, and Windows—would have added a stronger data-driven basis for the architectural recommendations made.

Throughout the project, I interpreted the user’s needs by emphasizing core requirements such as scalability, platform compatibility, uniqueness enforcement, and effective session management. These were reflected in the architecture design, domain modeling with unique ID systems, and secure backend services. Designing with the user’s needs in mind is crucial to ensuring the software is not only functional but also intuitive, reliable, and aligned with real-world expectations—factors that significantly contribute to the product’s success and adoption.

My approach to software design included applying object-oriented principles, utilizing a layered architectural model, and creating UML class diagrams to map system relationships. I also conducted a comparative analysis of platforms and aligned design decisions with client requirements.

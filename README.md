## 🎮 The Gaming Room – Draw It or Lose It

Draw It or Lose It is a Java-based drawing and guessing game inspired by the classic game show *Win, Lose or Draw*. Developed as part of SNHU's CS-230 Software Design and Development course, this project demonstrates key object-oriented design principles, modular architecture, and collaborative software engineering practices.

## ✨ Features

- Multi-team game mode with unique identifiers
- Role-based structure (host, team members)
- Modular Java architecture
- Console-based interface (future support for GUI/web planned)

##  📌 Client Requirements and Software Design Evaluation

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a game development company that originally launched the game Draw It or Lose It as an Android application. They retained Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to redesign the game as a web-based, cross-platform application. 

To meet The Gaming Room’s goals, the software must accommodate games with several teams, allow each team to have multiple players, enforce unique game and team names, and ensure that only one instance of the game can exist at any time by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player. To meet these requirements CTS will develop an object-oriented solution with name validation and session management that ensures the game remain functional across all intended platforms.

The software design document presents a sound blueprint to expand Draw It or Lose It’s platform while maintaining its existing user experience. It outlines a successful development approach identifying and providing strong solutions for the game’s expansion requirements and design constraints. This is communicated through the use of UML Diagrams, system architecture and detailed platform evaluations. The documentation provides the functionality of the software needed to create test cases for quality assurance as well as guarantee the user’s need for fast and fun gameplay are met. 

If I could revise one part of my documentation, I would improve the clarity and formatting of the evaluation section that compares operating systems and platforms. The chart could better define how each system impacts the evaluation criteria and goals of the client. In the future I would use a similar evaluative structure but would include more visual aids to make the information palatable.
